# Trivia

A simple app that provides questions from the Video Game category and allows to test your knowledge on them. The API provides a token that is saved to local storage and active for around 6 hours, within that time the questions should not repeat upon playing again.

## Description

This project was created mostly for fun and to test myself on the questions that the API provides. Surprisingly I do pretty horrible even though I've played a lot of video games. I haven't managed to get a maximum score even once and had to cheat for testing purposes.
